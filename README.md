**Repository Name:** `Car_Price_Prediction`

**Description:**

This repository contains a **Car Price Prediction** project built using **Python** and **Streamlit**. The project uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained on a dataset of car details to predict the selling price of used cars. 

Key features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the distribution of car prices and other key features.
- **Modeling**: Training a machine learning model using Random Forest Regressor.
- **Streamlit Web App**: A user-friendly web application that allows users to input car details and predict its price.
- **Deployment**: The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for real-time predictions.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Regressor
- Joblib (for model saving)
  
This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning** and **data visualization** to create an interactive car price prediction tool.
